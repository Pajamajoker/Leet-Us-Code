    EXPLANATION (n -> floors, e -> eggs count)
    1) F[n][e] = min(max(F[n-x][e], F[x-1][e-1]) + 1)
                x = 1->n-1
    Minimize the max (worst case) to get least no. of tries to get the right floor.

    F[n-x][e] is when egg doesn't break. e remains same and we need to focus on higher
    floors (n-x)

    F[x-1][e-1] is when egg does break. e-1 eggs left. So to find breaking point floor, 
    we go down (x-1).

    The +1 at the end is for counting the one try (dropping egg) from current floor, 
    irrespective of whether egg is broken or not

    2) 2 constraints: F[1][e] = 1 as if we have 1 floor left and any no. of eggs,
    only 1 try is possible anyways. F[n][1] = n as if we have n floors to check and 1 egg
    left, we start from bottom floor and keep dropping same egg in each higher floor till 
    it breaks. (worst case n floors)
