// Keep check of indegree of each node. Whichever ones have 0 as indegree, push then to Queue. Then pop out top of Q (and add this node to final ans vector), 
// check if it has adj nodes, and reduce their indegree by 1. If it becomes 0, push it to Q and so on. 

// In topo sort, if u->v edge exists in graph, in topo sort order u comes before v. Kahn's algo always starts from a vertex w indegree 0. As nodes are added to final ans,
// their adj node's dependency factor dec. by 1 and hence we subtract.
